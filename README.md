## Installation

You can install it using the gh cli extension.

```
gh extensions install fchimpan/gh-workflow-stats
```

## Quick Start

If you want to get the success rate and execution time of a workflow:

```sh
$ gh workflow-stats -o $OWNER -r $REPO -f ci.yaml
```

If you want to get the success rate and execution time of a workflow job in JSON format:

```sh
$ gh workflow-stats jobs -o $OWNER -r $REPO -f ci.yaml --json
```

## Usage

```sh
$ gh workflow-stats -h
Get workflow runs stats. Retrieve the success rate and execution time of workflows.

Usage:
  workflow-stats [flags]
  workflow-stats [command]

Examples:
$ gh workflow-stats --org $OWNER --repo $REPO -f ci.yaml

Available Commands:
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  help        Help about any command
  jobs        Fetch workflow jobs stats. Retrieve the steps and jobs success rate.

Flags:
  -a, --actor string            Workflow run actor
  -A, --all                     Target all workflows in the repository. If specified, default fetches of 100 workflow runs is overridden to all workflow runs.
  -b, --branch string           Workflow run branch. Returns workflow runs associated with a branch. Use the name of the branch of the push.
  -C, --check-suite-id int      Workflow run check suite ID
  -c, --created string          Workflow run createdAt. Returns workflow runs created within the given date-time range.
                                 For more information on the syntax, see https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/understanding-the-search-syntax#query-for-dates

                                 See https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/actions#list-workflow-runs-for-a-repository

Use "workflow-stats [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

### Fetch number of workflow

By default, `workflow-stats` and `workflow-stats jobs` commands will return **100** workflow runs. If you want to get all workflow runs, you can use the `--all` flag.
However, GitHub API has a rate limit, so please combine other parameters as appropriate to reduce the number of API requests.

```sh
# Get executed at 2022-01-01 or later and actor is $ACTOR
$ gh workflow-stats -o $OWNER -r $REPO -f ci.yaml -A -c ">2024-01-01" -a $ACTOR
```

More details on API rate limits can be found in the [GitHub API documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/rate-limits-for-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28).

### GitHub Enterprise Server

If you want to use GitHub Enterprise Server, you can use the `--host` flag or set the `GH_HOST` environment variable.
Host name is `http(s)://[your-github-host]/api/v3/`

```sh
$ export GH_HOST="your-github-host"
$ gh workflow-stats -o $OWNER -r $REPO -f ci.yaml
# or
$ gh workflow-stats -o $OWNER -r $REPO -f ci.yaml --host="your-github-host"
```

### How it works
This tool retrieves workflow execution statistics using the GitHub API. For more details on the parameters, please refer to the GitHub API reference.
- [Workflow runs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/workflow-runs?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-workflow-runs-for-a-workflow)
- [Workflow jobs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/workflow-jobs?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-job-for-a-workflow-run)

## Standard Output

[Sample output](./images/sample-output.txt)

### üèÉ Total runs

`Total runs` is the total number of workflow runs that `status` is `completed`. It includes `success`, `failure`, and `others` outcomes. `Others` outcomes include `cancelled`, `skipped`, etc.

### ‚è∞ Workflow run execution time stats

`Workflow run execution time stats` is the average execution time of workflows with **`success` conclusion and `completed` status**.

### üìà Top 3 jobs with the highest failure counts (failure runs / total runs)

`Top 3 jobs with the highest failure counts` is the top 3 jobs with the highest failure counts. It is **not** failure rate.
Instead of using the success rate, the tool displays jobs based on the number of failures, as jobs with fewer executions but a high failure rate would otherwise be ranked higher.

 The number of jobs displayed can be changed with a command-line argument `-n`.


### üìä Top 3 jobs with the longest execution average duration

`Top 3 jobs with the longest execution average duration` is the top 3 jobs with the longest execution average duration.

The number of jobs displayed can be changed with a command-line argument `-n`.

## JSON Schema Overview

If you use `--json` flag, the output will be a JSON object with the following structure. You can see sample output in [sample-output.json](./images/sample-output.json).
